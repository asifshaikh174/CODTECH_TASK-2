**Domain :** Data Analytics 

**Duration :** Aug to Oct 2024 

**Mentor :** MUZAMMIL AHMED


**Overview of the project :**

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging a large dataset of tweets, the goal is to classify the sentiment expressed in each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis can be particularly useful for understanding public opinion on various topics, brands, or events.

**Project Objectives :** 

**1. Data Collection :**

Gather a dataset of tweets using Twitter’s API or a pre-existing dataset.
Preprocess the raw tweet data to clean and prepare it for analysis.

**2. Data Preprocessing :**

Perform text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
Convert text data into a suitable format for modeling, such as word embeddings or term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectors.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :**

Conduct EDA to understand the distribution of sentiment labels.
Visualize the most common words or phrases associated with each sentiment.
Analyze the length of tweets, word frequency, and other relevant text features.

**4. Sentiment Classification :**

Implement machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify tweet sentiment.
Alternatively, explore deep learning approaches like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for sentiment classification.
Train and evaluate the models using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**5. Model Evaluation and Tuning :**

Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

**6. Insights and Conclusions :**

Summarize the key findings from the sentiment analysis.
Discuss the potential applications of sentiment analysis on Twitter data.
Highlight any limitations of the analysis and suggest directions for future work.

**Key Activities :** 

• Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from inconsistencies and missing values.

• Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to understand data distributions, tweets, and comments.

**Tools and Technologies Used :** 

• Programming Language: Python

• Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

• Environment: Jupyter Notebook

**Conclusion :**

This project provides a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis on Twitter data using NLP techniques. By classifying the sentiment of tweets, the analysis can offer valuable insights into public opinion and trends, which can be leveraged by businesses, researchers, and policymakers.
